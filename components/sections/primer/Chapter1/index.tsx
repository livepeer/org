            Livepeer is a scalable Platform as a Service for developers who want
            to add live or on-demand video to their project. It aims to increase
            the reliability of video streaming while reducing costs associated
            with it by up to 50x.
          </p>

            To achieve this Livepeer is building p2p infrastructure that
            interacts through a marketplace secured by the Ethereum blockchain.
