              Today, 80% of all internet bandwidth is consumed by video
              streaming.
            </h3>
            <p>
              Itâ€™s easy to understand why: video is engaging, educational,
              illuminating, and empowering ðŸ’ª.

              But, for companies, video is insanely expensive to stream â€” and
              even more expensive to live stream.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why? Because broadcasters who want to distribute video on the
              internet need to first transcode it.

              Transcoding is the process of taking a raw video file and
              reformatting it so that no matter what bandwidth you have -
              whether 2g or 5g - and no matter what device, you're ensured the
              most optimal viewing experience.

            <p>
              Today, this process costs around $3 per stream per hour to a cloud
              service such as Amazon, up to $4500 per month for one media
              server, and up to $1500 per month before bandwidth for a content
              delivery network. That's a lot!

              Due to such high infrastructure costs, it's become commonplace for
              aspiring social video startups to find initial success upon
              launch, adding hundreds of thousands of users in a single month,
              only to end up with multi-million dollar streaming bills that
              drain their funding prior to finding a working business model. As
              a result, startups are forced to tax their users by selling their
              data, bombard them with ads, or shut down operations completely.
            </p>
            <p>
              Demand for video services is increasing exponentially on the
              infrastructure side with the arrival of 4k video, ultra-HD, VR
              streaming, and all the cord-cutting that's moving broadcasts off
              of the traditional broadcast pipes and on to the internet.Â
