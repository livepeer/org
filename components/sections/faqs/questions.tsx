    answer: (

        <p sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
          Setting up your own broadcaster connected directly to the Livepeer
          public network and using the Livepeer.com hosted service both allow
          you to transcode on the same scalable, reliable, affordable Livepeer
          public network. Initial setup for a Broadcaster node can involve some
          DevOps and requires that you pay in a cryptocurrency (ETH). But, there
          is large, global Livepeer community ready to help. The Livepeer
          Discord server is very active.

          Livepeer.com is great getting started quickly and growing a video
          platform fast with the complexities of blockchain and cryptocurrencies
          abstracted away for you. It offers a scalable end-to-end video
          infrastructure solution, from ingest to CDN playback for live and
          recorded streams. Don’t hesitate to reach out on the Discord server or
          via a contact form on livepeer.com to learn more about either option.

        The price you should set should be based on the max price broadcasters
        are willing to pay. For example, Livepeer Inc’s broadcasters have a max
        price set at 3k wei per pixel which comes out to around 40 cents per
        hour per stream for its customers so if you want to win this work set
        your price at or below 3k wei per pixel.
