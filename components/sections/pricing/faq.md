### **How are transcoding, storage, and delivery minutes derived?**

For transcode and storage, Livepeer Inc uses the duration of the source asset,
and for delivery, it uses 70 minutes viewed per 1 GB delivered; These
assumptions are based on usage characteristics of the median builder.

If you have further questions about these calculations or feel that they do not
accurately reflect the characteristics of your project's usage, you may reach
