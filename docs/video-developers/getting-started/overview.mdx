# Overview

The getting started tutorial will walk you through the steps required to send a
livestream into the Livepeer public network for transcoding and play it back
inside your application.

> Note: for the sake of this guide, we'll be live streaming using the Rinkeby
> testnet network. You can think of this network like a sandbox environment for
> testing your live streams. If you're live-streaming in a production setting
> make sure to change the network to "mainnet". Learn more about supported
> networks, including "mainet" and Rinkeby,
> [here](/docs/installation/connect-to-ethereum#supported-networks).

## Pre-requisites

- Make sure you have `livepeer` [installed](/docs/installation/install-livepeer)

  [Ethereum JSON-RPC URL](/docs/installation/connect-to-ethereum)
