# Command Line Flags

`livepeer` can be configured with a number of command line flags.

In the future, more thorough documentation for command line flag usage will be
added. For now, a list of the available command line flags can be found in
[this file](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/blob/master/cmd/livepeer/livepeer.go).
The
[go-livepeer developer docs](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/tree/master/doc)
also contain instructions for using certain command line flags to enable certain
functionality in `livepeer`.
