## Pre-requisites

- Make sure your orchestrator is running

## Check public accessibility

1. Install [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl#installation)

2. Clone the go-livepeer repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer
   ```

3. Query the gRPC server that should be running at your orchestrator's service
   address:

   ```bash
   # <SERVICE_ADDR> should be your orchestrator's service address
   grpcurl -insecure -import-path go-livepeer/net -proto lp_rpc.proto <SERVICE_ADDR> net.Orchestrator/Ping
   ```

   If the request is successful, you should see a response that looks like (the
   actual value does not matter):

   ```bash
   {
       "value": "xpLwLD/j/pk102yS5zsF7/EbF1FsWOo9IAYd4ojyfG4vTC/MtA/4VtwTYt1WmyCSuGdkIKhmWZ2C7ovW8CLuIhw="
   }
   ```
