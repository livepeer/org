# Dual Mine

## Pre-requisites

- Make sure you have
  [activated your orchestrator](/docs/video-miners/getting-started/activation)

## Dual ethash mining and transcoding

### Choosing a miner

Dual ethash mining and transcoding has been tested on the GPUs in
[this list](https://github.com/livepeer/wiki/blob/master/GPU-SUPPORT.md) and
with the following miners:

- [t-rex](https://github.com/trexminer/T-Rex)
- [ethminer](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer)

If you successfully test with other miners, contributions to this document are
welcome.

If you are using a Nvidia GPU from the Volta generation or later, you can use
[CUDA MPS](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/mps/index.html) to try to improve
parallelization of the ethash mining and transcoding workloads. Refer to the
[GPU NVENC/NVDEC support matrix](https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-and-decode-gpu-support-matrix-new)
for the generation that a GPU is from.

If you are using a post-Volta GPU, the recommendation is to use ethminer because
it exposes flags for more granular adjustments to the GPU workload which will be
needed when using CUDA MPS to prevent the miner from fully staturating the GPU.
Other miners that support similar flags can be substituted for ethminer as well.

If you are using a pre-Volta GPU, the recommendation is to use t-rex because it
is, at the time of writing, the most popular and efficient ethash miner that has
been tested with `livepeer`. Other miners that have been tested successfully
with `livepeer` can be substituted for t-rex as well.

Note that regardless of the miner used, the VRAM available on your GPU will
affect the number of concurrent streams that can be transcoded while mining.

### Run the miner

The following instructions will assume you are using either t-rex or ethminer.
If you are using a different miner, the miner commands should be updated to
reflect the requirements of the miner being used.

If you are using CUDA MPS, start the MPS server by following
[these instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/mps/index.html#topic_6_1_2)

Take note of the following points that are mentioned in the docs:

- The `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable should be set with device IDs
  of the GPUS you will be using before the MPS daemon is started, but it should
  NOT be set before starting the miner and `livepeer`
- If you are using a mix of pre-Volta and post-Volta GPUs, make sure to read
  this [section](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/mps/index.html#topic_3_3_4) to
  avoid device ID issues

If you are using ethminer, run ethminer with flags to adjust the GPU workload
(other flags to connect to a mining pool omitted):

```bash
ethminer \
  -U \
  --cu-devices <GPU_DEVICE_IDS> \ # List of Nvidia GPU IDs
  --cuda-streams <CUDA_STREAMS> \ # Number of multiprocessor streams
  --cuda-block-size <CUDA_BLOCK_SIZE> \ # Number of threads per block
  --cuda-grid-size <CUDA_GRID_SIZE> \ # Number of blocks per grid
```

The `--cuda-streams`, `--cuda-block-size` and `--cuda-grid-size` flags are used
to adjust the GPU workload. The best values to use for these flags will depend
on your GPU and whether you want lower hashrate and faster transcoding speed or
higher hashrate and lower transcoding speed.

If you are using t-rex, run t-rex with a flag to adjust mining intensity (other
flags to connect to a mining pool omitted):

```bash
t-rex \
  -a ethash \
  -d <GPU_DEVICE_IDS> \ # List of Nvidia GPU IDs
  -i <MINING_INTENSITY \ # The mining intensity
```

The `-i` flag is used to adjust the mining intensity. Note that in testing, this
flag did not seem to provide very granual control over the GPU workload so
adjusting it to a level at which CUDA MPS could work led to a larger hashrate
drop which is why ethminer is recommended if you plan on using CUDA MPS.

### Run livepeer

1. Wait until the miner completes DAG generation

2. Run `livepeer` on the same machine as the miner and using the same GPU device
   IDs as the miner with the `-nvidia` flag

3. `livepeer` will need to be stopped when the miner re-generates the DAG to
   avoid transcoding issues and can be re-started when DAG generation completes

### Switching

Instead of always concurrently ethash mining and transcoding, it could also be
possible to switch between the two to maximize mining efficiency when there is
low transcoding demand and maximize transcoding capacity when there is high
transcoding demand.
