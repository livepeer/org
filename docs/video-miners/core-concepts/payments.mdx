# Payments

## Per Pixel Pricing

The value of payments is based on the number of pixels of video transcoded.
Orchestrators advertise a price per pixel off-chain. Broadcasters filter and
select orchestrators based on a maximum price per pixel that they are willing to
pay for transcoding.

The video profiles requested by broadcasters will impact the number of pixels
transcoded. A higher number of video profiles or more complex video profiles
will require more pixels to be transcoded and also require more payments.

## Probabilistic Micropayments

Payments are implemented using a
[probabilistic micropayment protocol](https://medium.com/livepeer-blog/streamflow-probabilistic-micropayments-f3a647672462).

Broadcasters send lottery tickets to orchestrators in exchange for transcoded
results. Each lottery ticket is defined with a face value, the payout to the
orchestrator if the ticket wins, and the probability that the ticket will win.
Each ticket is treated as a micropayment worth the expected value of the ticket
(calculated as face value multiplied by the winning probability). Orchestrators
will redeem winning tickets on-chain to receive the face value of tickets.
