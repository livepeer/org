# Payments

## Per Pixel Pricing

The value of payments is based on the number of pixels of video transcoded.
Orchestrators advertise a price per pixel off-chain. Broadcasters filter and
select orchestrators based on a maximum price per pixel that they are willing to
pay for transcoding.

The video profiles requested by broadcasters will impact the number of pixels
transcoded. A higher number of video profiles or more complex video profiles
will require more pixels to be transcoded and also require more payments.

## Probabilistic Micropayments

Payments are implemented using a
[probabilistic micropayment protocol](https://medium.com/livepeer-blog/streamflow-probabilistic-micropayments-f3a647672462).

Broadcasters send "lottery tickets" to Orchestrators in exchange for transcoded
results. Each "lottery ticket" is defined with:

- a _face value_: the payout to the orchestrator if the ticket wins, and
- a _probability that the ticket will win_.

Each ticket is treated as a micropayment worth the _expected value_ of the
ticket (calculated as: _face value_ multiplied by _probability that the ticket
will win_).

Orchestrators set a required ticket expected value (EV) which defines the value
of work an orchestrator is willing to do before requiring a ticket. For example,
if the ticket EV is set to 1000 gwei, then the orchestrator is willing to do
1000 gwei worth of work before requiring a ticket. The default ticket EV in
`livepeer` is set to be reasonable (1000 gwei) so at this time orchestrator
operators are encouraged to just use the default because using a non-default
value could lead to broadcasters excluding an orchestrator from selection due to
the broadcaster's max ticket EV (which has a default that is set based on the
default ticket EV).

Orchestrators will redeem winning tickets on-chain, to receive the _face value_
of tickets.
