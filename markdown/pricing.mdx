# Livepeer Pricing

Running your own Livepeer node infrastructure can be challenging, especially
when getting started or scaling fast. Service providers run optimized node
infrastructure for you, so you can focus on building your video applications or
product instead.

These hosted gateway services typically provide an API key that you can use to
broadcast video streams into the network, paying on your behalf at a market rate
determined by the open Livepeer network. It's up to them to set and advertise
additional pricing structures on top of this market rate.

Today, Livepeer Inc, the initial team behind the Livepeer protocol, operates the
most popular hosted gateway service. Information about its pricing structure can
be found below.
