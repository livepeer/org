The term **bristlecone pine** covers three
[species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species "Species") of
[pine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine "Pine") tree (family
[Pinaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinaceae "Pinaceae"), genus
[_Pinus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus "Pinus"), subsection
_Balfourianae_). All three species are long-lived and highly resilient to harsh
weather and bad soils. One of the three species, _Pinus longaeva_, is among the
longest-lived life forms on Earth. The oldest _Pinus longaeva_ is more than
5,000 years
old,[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine#cite_note-oldest-1)
making it the oldest known individual of any species.

Despite their potential age and low reproductive rate, bristlecone pines,
particularly _Pinus longaeva_, are usually a
[first-succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_succession "Primary succession")
species, tending to occupy new open
ground.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine#cite_note-FEIS-2)
They generally compete poorly in less-than-harsh environments, making them hard
to
cultivate.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine#cite_note-FEIS-2)
In gardens, they succumb quickly to root
rot.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine#cite_note-3) They do
very well, however, where most other plants cannot even grow, such as in rocky
[dolomitic](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolomite_(mineral)> "Dolomite (mineral)")
soils in areas with virtually no
rainfall.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine#cite_note-FEIS-2)

Bristlecone pines grow in scattered
[subalpine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subalpine "Subalpine") groves at high
altitude in arid regions of the
[Western United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States "Western United States").
Bristlecones, along with all related species in class Pinopsida, are
[cone-bearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer_cone "Conifer cone")
[seed plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_plant "Seed plant") commonly
known as [conifers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer "Conifer"); the name
comes from the prickles on the female
cones.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine#cite_note-ARKive-4)
