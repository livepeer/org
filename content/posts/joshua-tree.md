The Joshua tree is also called _izote de desierto_ (Spanish, "desert
dagger").[\[6\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-ITIS-6)
It was first formally described in the botanical literature as _Yucca
brevifolia_ by
[George Engelmann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Engelmann "George Engelmann")
in 1871 as part of the Geological Exploration of the 100th meridian (or
"[Wheeler Survey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeler_Survey "Wheeler Survey")").[\[7\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-IPNI-7)

The name "Joshua tree" is commonly said to have been given by a group of
[Mormon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon "Mormon") settlers crossing the
Mojave Desert in the mid-19th century: The tree's role in guiding them through
the desert combined with its unique shape reminded them of
[a biblical story](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_of_Ai "Conquest of Ai")
in which [Joshua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua "Joshua") keeps his
hands reached out for an extended period of time to guide the Israelites in
their conquest of Canaan
([Joshua 8:18â€“26](<https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/Joshua#8:18> "s:Bible (King James)/Joshua")).[\[8\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-jtnp-8)[\[9\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-9)[\[10\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-10)
However, no direct or contemporary attestation of this origin exists, and the
name Joshua tree is not recorded until after Mormon
contact;[\[8\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-jtnp-8)[\[11\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-11)
moreover, the physical appearance of the Joshua tree more closely resembles
[a similar story](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rephidim "Rephidim") told of
[Moses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses "Moses").[\[12\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-12)

Ranchers and miners who were contemporary with the Mormon immigrants used the
trunks and branches as fencing and for fuel for ore-processing steam engines.
They referred to these fallen or collapsed Joshua trees as _tevis_
stumps.\[_[citation needed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

In addition to the
[autonymic](<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonym_(botany)> "Autonym (botany)")
[subspecies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies "Subspecies") _Yucca
brevifolia_ subsp. _brevifolia_, two other subspecies have been
described:[\[13\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-13)
_Y. b._ subsp. _jaegeriana_ (the Jaeger Joshua tree or Jaeger's Joshua tree or
pygmae yucca) and _Y. b._ subsp. _herbertii_ (Webber's yucca or Herbert Joshua
tree), though both are sometimes treated as
varieties[\[6\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-ITIS-6)[\[14\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-Grandtner2005-14)[\[15\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-15)
or
forms.[\[16\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_brevifolia#cite_note-Egglid2001-16)
