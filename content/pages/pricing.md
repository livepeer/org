# Livepeer Pricing

Running your own Livepeer broadcasting infrastructure can be challenging,
especially when getting started or while scaling fast. There exists Livepeer
broadcasting providers who run hosted infrastructure behind the scenes for you
so you can focus on building video experiences in your application instead.

Livepeer broadcasting providers typically provide an API key which you can use
to publish video streams into the network, and they pay the network on your
behalf at market rates determined by the open network. It's up to providers to
set and advertise their own pricing structures.

Today, Livepeer Inc, the initial team behind the Livepeer protocol, runs the
most popular hosted gateway service. They've included information about their
pricing structure below.

## What costs are associated with livestreaming?

There are three costs associated with livestreaming.

**Transcoding** - the ingesting of video to the Livepeer network ($0.005

ever exceeded the 1,000 min/month free plan. But, if this is a concern email
